# Sun Movement Data Visualization

A real-time, generative Pygame visualization that morphs a mystical "sun totem" through multiple organic shapes (sun ‚Üí moon ‚Üí cloud ‚Üí flower) while reacting to the (mock) sun position across the day. It overlays live textual data (time, sunrise/sunset, computed sun position fraction) and renders thousands of smoothly animated particles with layered rotation, ripples, pulses, and palette shifts tied to the diurnal cycle.

---
## ‚ú® Features
- 4,000+ animated radial particles forming a morphing energy totem
- Shape cycling: sun ‚Üí moon ‚Üí cloud ‚Üí flower (smooth blended transitions)
- Time-based color modulation using a generated HSV gradient palette
- Dynamic background with layered ripple effects & subtle parallax particles
- Real-time overlay: clock, sunrise, sunset, sun position fraction, frame counter
- Modular structure for future expansion (data providers, astronomy API, theming)
- Clean separation between:
  - Visual core (`Sun Movement Data.py`)
  - Mock astronomical time helpers (`sun_times.py`)
  - Mock positional/elevation dataset (`data_fetcher.py`)

## üóÇ Project Structure
```
Sun Movement Data.py    # Main executable visualization (Pygame loop)
data_fetcher.py         # Mock sun elevation/azimuth/intensity time series (Pandas)
sun_times.py            # Mock sunrise/sunset + fractional position helper
__pycache__/            # Python bytecode cache (ignored in Git typically)
README.md               # This file
requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
```

## üêç Requirements
- Python 3.11+ (tested against 3.13 bytecode ‚Äì adjust if needed)
- pip (for dependency installation)
- A display environment (runs natively on Windows; works on macOS/Linux with a normal desktop session)

### Python Dependencies
Declared in `requirements.txt`:
- `pygame` ‚Äì real-time rendering
- `pandas` ‚Äì structured mock dataset generation

Install them (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you use a virtual environment (recommended):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Visualization
From the project root:
```powershell
python "Sun Movement Data.py"
```
A window titled "Mystical Sun Totem Visualization" should appear. If it does not come to the foreground automatically, check:
- Another window may have focus
- GPU driver overlay conflicts
- Remote desktop session (sometimes Pygame window layering is delayed)

Exit via the window close button (standard Pygame quit event).

## üî¢ Data & Computation Overview
| Aspect | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sunrise/Sunset | `fetch_sun_times()` in `sun_times.py` | Currently hard-coded daily mock values (6:30 / 18:45) |
| Sun Position Fraction | `get_sun_position_fraction()` | Fraction of total day + sinusoidal variation to keep visuals lively |
| Particle Field | `SunTotem` + `Particle` classes | Procedural radial system with breathing + bloom modifiers |
| Background Particles | `BackgroundParticle` | Slow-floating ambient field (400 instances) |
| Elevation/Azimuth Table | `DataFetcher._generate_mock_data()` | 24h grid with randomized perturbations every 15 min |

## üß™ Extending with Real Astronomy Data
You can replace mock logic with real calculations from libraries/APIs:
- `astral` (Python package) for solar times & elevation
- USNO / NOAA sunrise-sunset APIs
- `pyephem` / `skyfield` for precise ephemerides

Suggested integration path:
1. Replace `fetch_sun_times()` to return real `(sunrise_str, sunset_str)`.
2. Replace `get_sun_position_fraction()` with a normalized mapping of current time between astronomical dawn & dusk.
3. (Optional) Enhance `DataFetcher` to cache a day‚Äôs elevation + azimuth and smoothly interpolate.
4. Tie particle rotation speed or bloom parameters to sun elevation for more dynamic responsiveness.

## üé® Tuning & Customization
Modify constants near the top of `Sun Movement Data.py`:
| Constant | Purpose | Example Adjustment |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `PARTICLE_COUNT` | Density & fill detail | Lower to 2000 for performance |
| `RADIUS` | Core radius of totem | Increase for a larger inner hub |
| `BREATH_SPEED` | Pulsation speed | Slow to 0.3 for calmer visuals |
| `REPEAT_COUNT` | Layer multiplicity | 2‚Äì6 for less/more layering |
| `REPEAT_ROTATION_STEP` | Angular offset per layer | Try `2 * math.pi / 5` |
| `REPEAT_OFFSET` | Pixel offset per repeated layer | 10‚Äì30 for variety |

To experiment with palette generation, edit `get_gradient_palette()` and shift `base_hue` or saturation.

## üñ• Performance Notes
- 4k particles √ó 4 repeated layers ‚Üí many draws per frame; a mid-range GPU/CPU handles 60 FPS.
- If FPS dips:
  - Reduce `PARTIC
